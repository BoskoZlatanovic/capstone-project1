    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>My name is Bosko, I'm a 20-year-old ambitious and goal-oriented
        individual interested in technology and sports - basketball. Currently I'm 2nd
        year at RAF, Faculty of Computer Science.
        
        Alongside studies, I also enjoy playing basketball and spending time
        training and improving my skills on the court. I recognize the value of
        both academic and athletic pursuits and work hard to make the most of
        my opportunities.
        
        I would say I'm ambitious and driven, always seeking to grow and
        learn in both personal and professional life. An individual who
        embraces challenges and strives to make a positive impact in the world.
